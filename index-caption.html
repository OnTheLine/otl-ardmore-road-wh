        View the rapid growth of real estate development on Farmington Avenue in West Hartford by comparing <a href='https://www.loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps/?fa=location:west+hartford' target='_blank'>Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps for 1917 and 1923</a>. Ardmore Road was only a proposed street in 1917. Six years later, after the land was subdivided and the street and sewer lines were completed, at least 8 homes had been constructed, with room for many more. Three years later, a total of 43 homes were built by 1926, according to the city directory listing.
