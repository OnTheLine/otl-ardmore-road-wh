        In 1923, West Hartford property owners and town officials objected to Jacob Goldberg's application to build a small grocery store at the corner of Farmington Avenue and Ardmore Road. The proposed store was a smaller 60 x 80 foot building next door to the much larger West Hartford Armory building (shown in pink on the Sanborn map). Although Goldberg eventually prevailed and later opened Kingswood Market, this dispute motivated West Hartford to become the first municipality in Connecticut to adopt a zoning policy in 1924.

Ardmore Road was only a proposed street in 1917. Six years later, after the land was subdivided and the street and sewer lines were completed, at least 8 homes had been constructed, with room for many more. Three years later, a total of 43 homes were built by 1926, according to the city directory listing.
